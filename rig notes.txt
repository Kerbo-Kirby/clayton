-Hand control pivot points on both sides are in the wrong place

-The tip of the left index finger is missing

-All of the finger joints on both sides are not centered, they are on the back side of the sphere

-The joints on the right finger tips have a rotation value and scale values

-There is some very weird scale issues on most of the geometry

-The joints are positioned toward the back of the sphere on the arms too

-There is a problem with the movement of the right upper leg not staying connected (maybe not being constrained correctly)

-There is a problem with the movement of the right palm not staying connected (maybe not being constrained correctly)

-There are values on rotation or scale on most of your joints

-Your spine control should only control the top portion and you should have a COG control to control both

-The spine and the leg controls don't seem to be oriented correctly
